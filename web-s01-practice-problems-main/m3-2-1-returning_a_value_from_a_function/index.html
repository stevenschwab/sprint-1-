  <h1>Returning a Value From a Function</h1>

  <script>
    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Write a function that returns the string “If you let go of a string, does it return to you?”  Next, save the return value to a variable. Then print the variable to the console.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Write a function that subtracts one from the variable “number” which currently holds the value of 10, and returns that new value.  Next, save the return value to a variable and print it to the console (which should print 9).
    */
    let num = 10
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: First add a name to the variable declared below.  Next, write a function that concatenates any greeting, like "Nice to meet you", with the variable name, and returns that new string.  Save that string to a new variable and print it to the console.
   */
    let name = "insert name here"
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Remember that we have learned two ways to write functions: the standard way starting with the keyword "function", and a function expression that saves your function to a variable.  This time, write a function expression that updates the "dayOfTheWeek" variable declared below and returns the current day of the week.  Finally, execute that function and save the return value, the current day of the week, to a variable to print to the console.
    */
    let dayOfTheWeek
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following function returns a value that is “undefined”.  Add a line to the body of the function so that it prints “7” to the console.
    */
    /*
    function giveMeSeven() {
      let num = 7
    }

    const result = giveMeSeven()
    console.log(result)
    */
