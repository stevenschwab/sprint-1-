    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Write a function called "favoriteNum" that prints "My favorite number is " + (your favorite number) to the console.  Invoke that function so that your favorite number prints to the console.
    */
    function favoriteNum() {
      console.log("My favorite number is " + 9)
    }

    favoriteNum() // invoking function

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Write a function called "endProcess" that prints "Process has ended here." to the console.  Invoke that function to test that it works.
    */
    function endProcess() {
      console.log("Process has ended here.")
    }

    endProcess()

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Write a function called “foreverYoung” that prints “I am still 21” to the console whenever invoked.  Invoke three times to see it print three times in the console.
   */
    function foreverYoung() {
      console.log("I am still 21.")
    }

    foreverYoung() // invoking function 3 times
    foreverYoung()
    foreverYoung()

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Write a function called "duckDuckGoose" that prints "Duck" twice to the console, and "Goose" once, each on separate lines.  Invoke this function to see each print on separate lines in the console.
    */
    function duckDuckGoose() {
      console.log("Duck")
      console.log("Duck")
      console.log("Goose!")
    }

    duckDuckGoose()

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following function throws the error: “Syntax Error“. Fix the error so that the console prints “10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0”.
*/

    function finalCountdown() { // added keyword "function"
      console.log(10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
    }
