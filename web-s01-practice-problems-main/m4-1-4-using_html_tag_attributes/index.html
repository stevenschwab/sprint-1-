<!--
DIRECTIONS: Like we have seen before, the subject of these practice problems is constructing an HTML webpage from scratch.  So you will notice that all of our template code is missing.  Have no fear! Like always, take each problem one step at a time, and you will see how the HTML page transforms before your very eyes.

Also, please combine your answers to problems 1-5 together in one HTML markup.
-->


<!-- COMBINE YOUR CODE HERE FOR PROBLEMS 1-5 -->


<!-- PROBLEM 1: Again, practice constructing your own HTML document with these four items: "doctype declaration", and the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.  Try this one by memory first.-->

<!-- PROBLEM 2: Nested within the <body> tags add three <section> tags, and nested within each of those section tags two <article> tags. -->

<!-- PROBLEM 3:  Add unique names for each "id" attribute of the <section> tags, but the same name for their "class" attribute -->

<!-- PROBLEM 4: Add proper id and class names to all the articles using proper conventions.  Please note, feel free to give all six articles the same class name or unique names for each pair.  In reality, either could be acceptable depending on the circumstance. -->

<!-- PROBLEM 5: Finally, add some text between each opening and closing tag of the articles just to see what that might look like in the browser. -->

<!-- PROBLEM 6 (DEBUGGING): The following HTML markup will not work.  Find the mistake, so that the browser can clearly read its structure. -->

<!--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li id=home class="nav-links">Home</li>
            <li id=aboutUs class="nav-links">About Us</li>
            <li id=ourWork class="nav-links">Our Work</li>
            <li id=contact class="nav-links">Contact</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
  </body>
</html>
