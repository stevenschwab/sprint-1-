    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Declare a variable that holds a number value.  Include that variable as the first operand of a condition that includes one other operand separated by an OR operator.  Give the second operand a string value that prints "This will print if your number is 0."  Try assigning your variable a non-zero number and then 0, to see what changes.
