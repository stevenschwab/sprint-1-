  <h1>Adding Code to a Page Using VS Code</h1>
  <!--
    DIRECTIONS: Similar to the last two practice problems combined, these ones will have you editing both the HTML and Javscript code of this webpage.
      -->
  <!--
    PROBLEM 1: List three facts about you in the space below.
  -->
  <h3>More about me:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <!--ENTER YOUR CODE HERE -->
    </li>
    <li>
      <!--ENTER YOUR CODE HERE -->
    </li>
    <li>
      <!--ENTER YOUR CODE HERE -->
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!--
    PROBLEM 2: Write a little about how you got interested in software engineering:

    /*
    PROBLEM 3: Notice that this problem now comes within the <script> section where we can write our Javascript code and print things to the console.  Also notice that the syntax for comments changed from using arrows and hyphens to using stars and dashes.  Log to the console, your favorite animal:
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Log to the console how many hours of sleep you got last night.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): This next problem introduces a new practice problem type: the debugging problem. Since debugging (fixing) problems in code happens daily, we have added debugging problems in many practice problem sets. The key thing to note is that if a bug causes an error, it will prevent any of your other code from showing up on the webpage. To avoid this, we will initially comment out the debugging problem and ask that you remove the two dashes in front of this code when you are ready to try it. It's understandable at this stage if this is confusing. You may want to look at the solution for this first debugging problem for help.

     The following code does not print to the console.  Fix the bug so that the console prints: "This is the end of learning objective 3. Congrats!"
    */
    //console.log(This is the end of learning objective 3. Congrats!)
