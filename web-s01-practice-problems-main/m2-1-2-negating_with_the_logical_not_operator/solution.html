  <h1>Negating With the Logical Not (!) Operator SOLUTION</h1>

    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Declare a variable and assign it to any truthy value.  Log to the console the Boolean opposite of that variable's value using the not operator.
    */
    let weatherStatus = "Sunny"
    console.log(!weatherStatus) // prints false, but would be cool if it printed "rainy"

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Use the not operator to find the Boolean opposite of the value of 0.
    */
    console.log(!0) // prints true

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Log to the console a conditional statement that determines whether the boolean value of an empty string (remember to use the Boolean() function) is equal to the Boolean opposite of a non-empty string's value.
   */
    console.log(Boolean('') === !'Hello, World') // prints true

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Declare a variable and assign that variable any number.  Log to the console the boolean opposite of that variable's value.
    */
    let num = 9
    console.log(!num) // prints false

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following code is trying to reassign the value of "isLoggedIn" to its opposite value, but this code throws a "Type Error".  Try running the error first, then fix the problem so that the variable "isLoggedIn" can be set to the Boolean opposite of its current value.
    */
    let isLoggedIn = false // change "const" to "let" so that variable can be reassigned a value
    isLoggedIn = !isLoggedIn
    console.log(isLoggedIn)
