    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Write a function called “squareRoot()” that accepts one number as an argument.  Have this function print to the console the square root of any number that gets passed to it. To get the square root, you can use the exponent operator (**) with the value 1/2 (e.g., num ** (1/2)). Test your function with any number of your choice.

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Write a function called “greeting()” that accepts one name as an argument.  Require this function to then return (not console.log) the custom phrase “Hello, {name}” using concatenation. Invoke that function passing your name as an argument and saving its return value into a variable called “myGreeting”.  Finally, print this value to the console.

    /*
    PROBLEM 3: Declare a variable called "myAge" that is assigned a number value equal to your age.  Next, write a function called "ageInDogYears()" that takes one argument, "age", and calculates and prints to the console your age in dog years, which is (age / 7).  Test this function by passing "myAge" as an argument.

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Write a function, called “addToppings()” that accepts two arguments for two pizza topping choices.  Have this function ultimately concatenate and print out the sentence: “I ordered a pizza with {topping1} and {topping2}."

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following function throws a “Syntax Error: Unexpected identifier ‘num2’”.  Find the bug and fix the mistake so that the console prints “3”.

    function sum(num1 num2) {
