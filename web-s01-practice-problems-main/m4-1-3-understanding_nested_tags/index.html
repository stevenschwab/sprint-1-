<!--
DIRECTIONS: Since the subject of these practice problems is constructing an HTML webpage from scratch, you will notice that, compared to our previous practice problems, all of our template code is missing.  Have no fear! Like always, take each problem one step at a time, and you will see how the HTML page transforms before your very eyes.

Also, please combine your answers to problems 1-4 together in one HTML markup.
-->


<!-- COMBINE YOUR CODE HERE FOR PROBLEMS 1-4 -->

<!-- PROBLEM 1: Practice constructing your own HTML document with these four items: "doctype declaration", and the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.  Try this one by memory first.-->

<!-- PROBLEM 2: Add at least three different semantic tags (opening and closing) within the <body> section.  You can borrow some from our last two learning objectives or, if you are feeling adventurous, revisit the link that lists all the different semantic elements that you explored in our last practice problem set at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element and borrow some from there. -->

<!-- PROBLEM 3: Add two more tags, but nest these within two of the other tags you created in problem 2.    -->

<!-- PROBLEM 4: Finally, add some text within the parent tags and within the nested tags to see how it appears in the browser.  Do you see any semantic differences in font size, boldness, and positioning?-->

<!-- PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following HTML markup will not work for starting a new webpage.  Find the mistake, so that the browser can clearly read its structure. -->

<!--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
