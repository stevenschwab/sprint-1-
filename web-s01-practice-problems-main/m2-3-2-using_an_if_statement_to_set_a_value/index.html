  <h1>Using an If Statement to Set a Value</h1>

  <script>
    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Declare a variable called "weatherToday" without assigning any value to it.  Write a conditional statement to assign a value to "weatherToday" based on the value of the variable "currentTemp".  If the current temperature is greater or equal to 73 degrees fahrenheit, set "weatherToday" to be "Hot"; if less, set "weatherToday" to be "Cold".  Log the result to the console.
    */
    let currentTemp = 86;
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Assign a varible called "morning" and assign it a value of either true (to simulate it's morning time) or false (to simulate it's afternoon/evening time).  Write a conditional statement that adds one degree to the variable "currentTemp" if morning is set to "true", and another conditional statement that subtracts one degree if morning is set to "false".  Log the result to the console.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Declare a variable called "oddOrEven", without assigning any value to it. Write a conditional statement to assign a value to "oddOrEven", based on "value1" and "value2" already declared below. If both "value1" and "value2" are even numbers, assign to "oddOrEven" the value "Both are even numbers!" and print the result to the console. (Hint: you might want to use the remainder operator in conjuntion with two comparative operands)
   */

    let value2 = 2;

    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Borrowing the same variable "oddOrEven" from the last problem, write a conditional statement to assign "oddOrEven" the value: "Both are odd numbers!" if both "value1" and "value2" are odd, and print the result to the console.  (Hint: you might want to use the remainder operator in conjuntion with two comparative operands)
    */
    value1 = 3;
    value2 = 5;

    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following snippet throws a "TypeError".  Fix the error so that the conditional statement changes the variable "isLightOn" to true when the code runs.
    */
    /*
    const isLightOn = false
    if (!isLightOn) {
      isLightOn = true
