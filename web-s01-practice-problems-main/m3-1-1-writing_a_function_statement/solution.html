  <h1>Writing a Function Statement SOLUTION</h1>

    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1:  Write a function called "favoriteSong" that would print to the console "My favorite song is " + (your favorite song).
    */
    function favoriteSong() {
      console.log("My favorite song is " + "Uptown Funk")
    }

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Write a function called "testCode" that would print "Did the program run this?" to the console.  In theory, you could run this function whenever you encounter a part of your code that you suspect might never be run.
    */
    function testCode() {
      console.log("Did the program run this?")
    }

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Write a function called “leastFavoriteNum” that would print your least favorite number to the console followed by " is my least favorite number."
   */
    function leastFavoriteNum() {
      console.log(34 + " is my least favorite number.")
    }

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Create and name your own function that would print something to the console.
    */
    // Answers vary
    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following function throws the error: “Syntax Error“. Fix the error so that the console would print “1, 2, 3, 4, 5”.
*/

    function countUp() { // added parentheses
      console.log(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    }
