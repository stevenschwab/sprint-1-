    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Declare a variable using “let” and assign it any number value.  Now add five to that assigned value and log the variable to the console to confirm that five was added.
    */
    let num = 34
    num += 5
    console.log(num)

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Declare two variables that each hold two separate sentences.  Now declare a third variable that concatenates each of those sentences together.  Log that third variable to the console to confirm that both sentences have been concatenated together.
    */
    const sentenceOne = "I am the first sentence."
    const sentenceTwo = "I am the second sentence."

    const combinedSentence = sentenceOne + sentenceTwo

    console.log(combinedSentence)

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Declare two variables that each hold two separate numbers.  Now declare a third variable that multiplies those numbers together.  Log that third variable to the console to confirm that both numbers have been multipled together.
   */
    let firstNum = 56
    let secondNum = 89

    let combinedNum = firstNum * secondNum

    console.log(combinedNum)

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Declare a variable and assign it a number value.  Now declare a second variable and assign it a string value.  Now declare a third variable that concatenates those first two together.  Log that third variable to the console to see what happens.
    */
    const myNum = 9
    const myString = " is a string now."

    const numStringCombined = myNum + myString

    console.log(numStringCombined) // number 9 changes to a string when concatenated with a string

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following snippet throws a “Reference Error”.  Remove the asterix and slashes first to see the error, then fix the code so that the console prints 5, 6, and 106.
    */

    let count = 5
    console.log(count) // count was accidentally capitalized here
    count++
    console.log(count)
    count += 100
    console.log(count)
