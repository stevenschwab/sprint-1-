    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Declare a variable called “myFavoriteNum” using “const” that holds the value of your favorite number.
    */
    const myFavoriteNum = 7

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Now try to reassign "myFavoriteNum" variable to a new value.  Did it work?  What happened as a result?
    */
    myFavoriteNum = 8 // throws "Type Error: assignment to constant variable"

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Now try to redeclare a new variable using the same name "myFavoriteNum" and assign it a new value.  Did it work?  What happened as a result?
   */
    const myFavoriteNum = 9 // throws syntax error; "myFavoriteNum" has already been defined

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Declare a variable called “myFavoriteColor” using “const” that holds the string of your favorite color.
    */
    const myFavoriteColor = "green"

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following snippet throws a “Syntax Error”.  Erase the asterix and dashes to first see the error, then fix the code so that the dogsName variable holds the value of “Clifford”.
    */
    const dogsName = "Clifford" // need to declare variable and assign value at the same time
