    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Write a function expression that is saved to a variable named “totalMoney” and, when invoked, prints the total amount of money you think is in your favorite celebrity’s bank account.
    */
    const totalMoney = function () {
      console.log("Snoop Dogg has $45.6 million in his bank account.")
    }
    totalMoney()

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Write a function expression that is saved to a variable named “homeTown” and, when invoked, prints a string that states: “I am from (town you are from).”
    */
    const homeTown = function () {
      console.log("I am from Salt Lake City, UT.")
    }
    homeTown()

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Write a function expression that is saved to a variable named "addOne".  Within the body of this function, create a variable called "totalPoints" and assign it a value of 0.  On the next two lines (still within the function), add one to totalPoints and log the new total to the console.
   */
    const addOne = function () {
      let totalPoints = 0
      totalPoints++
      console.log(totalPoints)
    }
    addOne()

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Write a function expression that is saved to a variable named "updatePassword".  Within the body of this function, create a variable called "currentPassword" and assign it a string value (any password of your choice).  On the next two lines (still within the function), reassign your password to a new string and log the new password to the console.
    */
    const updatePassword = function () {
      let currentPassword = "BloomTech"
      currentPassword = "BloomTech 2.0"
      console.log(currentPassword)
    }
    updatePassword()

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following code does not print anything to the console.  Update the code so that the console prints “Summer is the best season of all.”
    */

    const favoriteSeason = function () {
      console.log("Summer is the best season of all.")
    }
    favoriteSeason() // added this line to invoke the function
