    PROBLEM 1: Declare a variable and assign to it a number.  Write a conditional statement so that if that number is...
      - less than 5, log to the console the string "Number is less than 5."
      - less than 10, log "Number is between 5 and 9."
      - less than 15,  log "Number is between 10-14."
    Else, log "This must be a big number."  After writing all the conditional statements, try inputting different numbers to your variable to see what changes.

      - equal to "Fish",  log "Yes!  You got it!!!"
    Else, log "Not it.  Try again."  After writing all the conditional statements, try inputting different values to "guessedWord" to see what changes.
