  <h1>Returning a Value vs. Printing a Value</h1>

  <script>

    /* DIRECTIONS: The first two problems of these practice problems are set up as refreshers on how to write side effect actions within a function.  The next two problems are set up as refreshers on how to return values within a function.  All four of these practice problems build on top of each other, so please do them in order and leave them all active as you continue to the next one.
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: First, declare a variable using the keyword "let" called "myFavoriteBook" that holds a string value of the title of your favorite book.  Write a function that prints the value of "myFavoriteBook".  Invoke that function to confirm that it works as expected.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Second, write another function called "updateBook()" that updates the value of "myFavoriteBook" to a new title of your choice.  Then, print that new title to the console, still within the function.  Invoke that function to confirm that it works as expected.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

     /*
    PROBLEM 3:  Third, write another function called “updateFavoriteBookAgain()” that changes the title of your favorite book, again, to another title; but, within this function return the new title of your favorite book.  Outside the function, invoke your function and save its return value to a variable, then log the return value to the console.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Finally, write another function called "updateFavoriteBookLastTime()" that changes the title of your favorite book to another title; but, within this function print to the console the following: "This is the last title change.", and still return the new title of your favorite book.  Outside the function, invoke your function and save its return value to a variable, then log to the console the return value.

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following code throws a “Reference Error: addedMessage is not defined”.  Fix the error so that the console prints: “What is so special about Katherine Johnson?” and “She ensured safe space travel!"

    /*
    let question = "What is so special about "
