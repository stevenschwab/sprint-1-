   PROBLEM 3: Declare a variable named “num” and assign it to a value of 7.  Log to the console a condition that uses an “AND” operator to check if “num” is equal to 7 and equal to “7”(with quotes).  Also log a condition that uses an “OR” operator to check the same two comparative expressions.  Did the two print the same or different boolean values?
