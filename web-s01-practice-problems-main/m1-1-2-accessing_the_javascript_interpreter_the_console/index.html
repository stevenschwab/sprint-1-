  <h1>Accessing the JavaScript Interpreter: The Console</h1>

  <p>This practice problem set, and many more to come, is only concerned with Javascript code. Thus, no new HTML
    elements will be displayed in the browser. Instead, your code is expected to appear in the "console" of the browser.

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Introduce yourself to the console by logging a greeting and stating your name below.  Just like in HTML, you can erase the comment "ENTER YOUR CODE HERE" and replace it with your own code.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Log to the console your favorite number. With numbers, you do not include quotations marks in console.log()
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 3: Log to the console the sentence: "I am logging the word 'log' while sitting on a log"
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Log to the console whether you are ready or not for the next learning objective.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
