  <h1>Changing the Outer World Using a Function SOLUTION</h1>
  <script>
    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Write a function that prints the following pin to the console.  Don't forget to invoke the function.
    */
    const pinToBePrinted = 8493
    function printPin() {
      console.log(pinToBePrinted)
    }
    printPin() // prints 8493

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Write a function that changes the value of the variable "funFact" below to another fun fact of your choice, then prints that new fun fact to the console.
    */
    let funFact = "You are born with about 300 bones, but end up with 206 as an adult."
    const changeFunFact = function () {
      funFact = "During infancy, many bones fuse together."
      console.log(funFact)
    }
    changeFunFact() // prints "During infancy, many bones fuse together."

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Write a function that declares an internal variable “message” and prints that message to the console.  Try also printing that message outside the function.  What happens?
   */
    function printMessage() {
      const message = "Who can print me?"
      console.log(message)
    }
    printMessage() // prints "Who can print me?"

    console.log(message) // throws 'Reference Error' because it can't access the "message" variable

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Write a conditional "if/elseif/else" statement that determines if the secret number (already declared below) is greater than, less than, or equal to 5.  For each statement have the console print out whether the secret number is greater than, less than, or equal to five.
    */
    const secretNumber = 2
    if (secretNumber > 5) {
      console.log("The secret number is greater than 5.")
    } else if (secretNumber < 5) {
      console.log("The secret number is less than 5.") // this prints
    } else {
      console.log("Yes! The secret number is 5 exactly!")
    }

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following function throws a “Reference Error”.  Correct the code so that the number being logged to the console after the function is invoked is 1.
    */

    function increment() {
      let num = 0
      num++
      console.log(num) // moved this to inside the function so it can access "num"
    }

    increment()
