    PROBLEM 1: Finish the logic for a fully-functional rock-paper-scissors game using the "player1" and "player2" variables below. The game should end by logging to the console one of the following outcomes:
          - "It is a draw"
          - "Player 1 wins with ROCK"
          - "Player 2 wins with ROCK"
          - "Player 1 wins with SCISSORS"
          - "Player 2 wins with SCISSORS"
          - "Player 1 wins with PAPER"
          - "Player 2 wins with PAPER"

Make sure to test the game thoroughly, trying all possible combinations of values for player1 and player2.  As an example, we provided the logic to one outcome.

rock - rock
paper- paper
scissors- scissors

rock- paper
rock- scissors

paper- scissors

    let player1 = 'ROCK';

    if (player1 === player2) {
      console.log('it is a draw');
    } else if (player1 === 'ROCK') {
      //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
    }
    //AND CONTINUE YOUR CODE HERE

    PROBLEM 2: A movie theater offers a discount for tickets based on age and time of day. Write a program in JavaScript that prompts the user for their age and the time of day (in 24-hour format) they plan to attend a movie, and then calculates the appropriate ticket price based on the following rules:

    - If the age is under 13, the ticket price is $7.
    - If the age is between 13 and 64 (inclusive) and the time is before 5pm, the ticket price is $10.
    - If the age is between 13 and 64 (inclusive) and the time is 5pm or later, the ticket price is $12.
    - If the age is 65 or older and the time is before 5pm, the ticket price is $8.
    - If the age is 65 or older and the time is 5pm or later, the ticket price is $10.

    Based on the ticket price, log to the console "The ticket price is $" + ticketPrice + "."

    let age = 24;
    let time = 15; // i.e., 3 PM
