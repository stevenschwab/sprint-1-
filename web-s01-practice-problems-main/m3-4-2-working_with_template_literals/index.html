    PROBLEM 1: Print to the console a template literal that embeds the number and string  values of 6 and “half a dozen” (aready declared below) into the string: “6 in one, half a dozen in the other.”

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Declare two variables and assign each one a string value of a different day of the week.  Write a function that prints to the console a string that uses a template literal that combines your variables in a sentence that reads: "I only shower on (one day) and (other day)." Finally, invoke that function to see if everything works as expected.

     /*
    PROBLEM 3: Below is the variable "previousGrade".  Declare a new variable called "newGrade" that uses a template literal to save the string: "My new grade is A, but my previous grade was a (previousGrade)."  Print that new variable to the consolet to confirm your code.
    */
    const previousGrade = "B"

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following block of code throws a “Syntax Error: Invalid or unexpected token".  Fix the code so that it prints each word of the string vertically.
