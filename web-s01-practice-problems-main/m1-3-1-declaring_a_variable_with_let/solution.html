    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Declare a simple variable with "let" that holds a string of the name of your favorite song.  Print the new value to the console.
    */
    let favoriteSong = "Software Engineering Rhapsody"

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Declare a variable using “let” that holds a number value.  Then reassign that variable to a value that is five more than the original.  Print the new value to the console.
    */
    let num = 5
    num = num + 5 // or num += 5

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Declare a variable using “let” that holds a string value.  Then reassign that variable to a new string.  Print the new string to the console.
   */
    let myString = "How do you make a telephone?"
    myString = "Connect two cans and a string."

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Declare a variable using “let” that holds an “undefined” value.  Then reassign that variable to a value that is either a string or a number.  Print the new value to the console.
    */
    let thisValue = undefined
    thisValue = 78

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following snippet throws a “Syntax Error”.  Erase the asterix and slashes to see the error first, then fix the bug so that the secret number “90” gets printed to the console.
    */
    let secretNum = 87
    secretNum += 3 // changed ++ to +=
