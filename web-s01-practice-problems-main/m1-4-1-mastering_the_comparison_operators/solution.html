    /*
    PROBLEM 1: First declare a variable “myNumber” and give it a value of 6.  Log to the console a comparative equation that determines if “myNumber” is greater than “3”.
    */
    let myNumber = 6
    console.log(myNumber > 3) // prints true

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Log to the console a comparative equation that determines whether “5-2” and “3” are equal.
    */
    console.log(5 - 2 === 3) // prints true

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Log to the console a comparative equation that determines if “Five” is greater than or equal to 3. Why do you think it returned the value it did?
   */
    console.log("Five" >= 3) // prints false

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Log to the console a comparative equation that determines if 5 is greater than or equal to 3.
    */
    console.log(5 >= 3) // prints true

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following snippet returns “false”.  Besides the number 7, change one thing in this expression so that its value would return “true”.
    */
    let num = 7
    console.log(7 >= num) // change ">" to ">="
