<!--
DIRECTIONS: Since all of these problems were done directly in the dev tools, we are limited in what solutions we can provide.  Please be advised.
-->

<!-- PROBLEM 1: If you haven't already, this would be a great time to run through the steps that we covered on the "How To Build It" section.  Go ahead and open your dev tools by right-clicking the "U.S." <li> element in the browser, and change the text to "National".  Also navigate to the "Styles" tab and change the color to "crimson".-->

The changes made in the dev tools should now look like this:

<li id="usNavLink" class="nav-links">National</li>

li {
font-size: 10px;
color: crimson;
border: 2px solid gray;
}

<!-- PROBLEM 2: Using the dev tools, navigate to the "Styles" section again and "uncheck" the border.  You should see that the gray borders around each <li> have disappeared. -->

Unable to show solution for this problem.

<!-- PROBLEM 3:  Using the dev tools, try adding a style to the <li> elements by clicking the space directly below the "border" style.  It might take a little tinkering (hitting the Enter or return key after each input might be best), but try typing in "margin: 10px".  You should see that <li> more spaced out. -->

The <li> box in the "Styles" tab should now look like this:

  li {
  font-size: 10px;
  color: crimson;
  border: 2px solid gray;
  margin: 10px;
  }


  <!-- PROBLEM 4:  In the "Elements" section of the dev tools, try adding another <li> called "Arts" to the list.  You can do this by right-clicking the "Sports" <li> and click "Edit as HTML".  Then you can move your cursor to the end of that line, click "Enter" or "Return" and start typing the new <li> line.  Again, it make take a little tinkering to get it to work, but give it a go! -->

  List should now look like this in "Elements" section:

<li id="usNavLink" class="nav-links">U.S.</li>
<li id="worldNavLink" class="nav-links">World</li>
<li id="businessNavLink" class="nav-links">Business</li>
<li id="sportsNavLink" class="nav-links">Sports</li>
<li id="artsNavLink" class="nav-links">Arts</li>

<!-- PROBLEM 5: Finally, in your dev tools navigate to the "Styles" tab and click the add style button, "+", near the top-right of that window.  You will see that a new style box will appear in the list of styles.  Try adding the following style to see if you can get the font color of just the "Business" section to turn "green".-->
<!--
            #businessNavLink {
                color: green;
            }
  -->
