<!--
DIRECTIONS: Since the subject of these practice problems is constructing an HTML webpage from scratch, you will notice that, compared to our previous practice problems, all of our template code is missing.  Have no fear! Like always, take each problem one step at a time, and you will see how the HTML page transforms before your very eyes.

Also, please combine your answers to problems 1-4 together in one HTML markup.

<!-- COMBINE YOUR CODE HERE FOR PROBLEMS 1-4 -->

<!-- PROBLEM 1: Practice constructing your own HTML document with these four items: "doctype declaration", and the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.-->

<!-- PROBLEM 2: Go ahead and add some text between the opening and closing <body> tags to see if it appears in the browser.-->

<!-- PROBLEM 3: Now add some text between the <head> tags to see if it too appears in the browser.  Anything? Spoiler Alert, it does!  As a reminder, adding a visible element anywhere on an HTML document will show up in the browser; however, it is a universally accepted practice to only include visual elements within the <body> tags. -->

<!-- PROBLEM 4: Also within the <body> tags, practice using the correct syntax to add the comment: "Need to add future elements here."  Verify that this comment does not appear in the browser.-->

<!-- PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following HTML markup will not work for starting a new webpage.  Find the mistake, so that the browser can clearly read its structure.-->

<!--
<DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    Can you see me yet?
  </body>
</html>
-->
