    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Use the variables that have already been declared below to answer the following problems.  These variables will hold boolean values that indicate your preference on whether or not you like to eat each one.
    */

    let likePizza;
    let likeGrasshoppers;
    let likeRamen;

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Reassign the variable "likePizza" to true or false depending on your preference.  Create a conditional statement that prints to the console "I like to eat pizza!" only if you assigned that variable a value of true.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Reassign the variable "likeGrasshoppers" to true or false depending on your preference.  Create a conditional statement that prints to the console "I don't like to eat grasshoppers!" only if you assigned that variable a value of false.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Reassign the variable "likeRamen" to true or false depending on your preference.  Create a conditional statement that prints to the console "Ramen for everyone!" whether or not you like it. (Hint you will have to include an "OR" operator in your conditional statement that separates two operands)
   */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Create a conditional statement that prints to the console "I like all foods!" only if all your variables are set to true.  (Hint you will have to include an "AND" operator in your conditional statement that separates three operands)
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following snippet throws a ReferenceError.  Fix the mistake so that the console prints: "I like seafood!"
    */
    /*
    if (likeSeafood) {
      console.log("I like seafood!")
    }
