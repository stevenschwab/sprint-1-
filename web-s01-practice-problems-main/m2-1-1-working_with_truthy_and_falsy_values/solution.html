    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Using the Boolean() function, log to the console a falsy value that includes a string.
    */
    console.log(Boolean('')) // prints false

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Using the Boolean() function, log to the console a truthy value that includes a number.
    */
    console.log(Boolean(7)) // prints true

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Declare a variable that has any kind of falsy value, besides an empty string.  Using the Boolean() function, log that value to the console.
   */
    let anyVariable = 0
    console.log(Boolean(anyVariable)) // prints false

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Log to the console a condition that determines whether the value undefined when converted to a boolean is equal to false.
    */
    console.log(Boolean(undefined) === false) // prints true

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following condition prints "false" in the console.  Find the error to make the condition render true.
    */
    console.log(Boolean("This is a string." === true)) // changed "=" to "===", now prints true
