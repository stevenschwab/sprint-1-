    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Log to the console a condition that checks if value1 AND value2 are both truthy, OR that value3 is truthy. What do you think will get printed?
    */
    const value1 = "I am a string"
    const value2 = 8
    const value3 = 0
    console.log((value1 && value2) || value3) // prints 8

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Log to the console a condition that checks if value1 OR value2 are both truthy, AND that value3 is truthy. What do you think will get printed?
    */
    console.log((value1 || value2) && value3) // prints 0

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Log to the console a condition that uses both an AND operator and an OR operator that only has operands with falsy values, and prints the falsy value of the very first operand.
   */
    console.log(null && (NaN || undefined)) // prints null

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Log to the console a condition that uses both an AND operator and an OR operator that only has operands with truthy values, and prints the truthy value of the very first operand.
    */
    console.log("Hello" || ("Goodbye" && "Goodnight")) // prints "Hello"

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following snippet prints "Not Me".  By only reworking the AND or OR operators, fix the code so that the console only prints "Print Me"
    */
    console.log(("Not Me" || "Not Me") && ("Print Me" || "Not Me")) // switched last two operators
